### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1 was especially memorable in Lap 9. Part 1 was to create a program to find the average. This was memorable because it was interesting to have the computer do a process that would have been tedious if I had to do it myself.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1, This was one of my favorite experiments because it's not hard to find the area of a square, but it was interesting to me to have a computer do it for me. This experiment helped me understand the concept of using functions.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, I was impressed with both part 1 and part 2 of this lab because I was curious about how game graphics and images are created in my computer science classes, and this lab allowed me to learn how. Also, it was memoriable since it was my last lab class.
